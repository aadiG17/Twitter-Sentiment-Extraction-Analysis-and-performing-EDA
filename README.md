# Twitter-Sentiment-Extraction-Analysis-and-performing-EDA
Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing a dataset containing social media user data. The goal is to explore user trends, follower statistics, and hashtags, leveraging interactive visualizations and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. By performing comprehensive data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and hashtag cleaning, this project lays the groundwork for future modeling tasks like sentiment analysis or user behavior prediction.

Key highlights of this project include:

Cleaning and transforming complex datasets with mixed data types.
Using Plotly for dynamic, interactive visualizations of user metrics.
Conducting NLP-based hashtag analysis and preparing data for advanced text modeling.
This repository serves as a showcase of data preprocessing, EDA, and visual storytelling, offering insights into both technical and creative aspects of data analysis.
